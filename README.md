# Math Speed Test
A simple game for math calculations. The idea was to code it so that it can be implemented:
- As a game that can be played through an input-based interface
- As a game using the GTK Library
- As a game using the curses Library
- As a game as a web app

It has a user-storage system so that many people can play in a local computer
